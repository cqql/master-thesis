An interesting extension to the autoencoder idea would be to sample new data
from sequences generated by the decoder and assess empirically if there is a
denoising effect.

Rolling autoencoder that keeps the state from batch to batch. I.e. you run one
autoencoder over the whole recording and just extract a frame every 2.5ms.

Bidirectional LSTM for classification and maybe even a bidirectional
autoencoder.
