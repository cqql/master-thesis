\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my advisor Guang Chen for making this thesis possible. I
would also like to thank the Human Brain Project group at the I6 chair for
providing a DVS and the mathematics chair M3 for donating computational
resources. Most of all, I would like to thank my family for their continued
support throughout my studies.
